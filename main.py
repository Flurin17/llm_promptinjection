                         Guide on how to prompt inject:
                         
                         Desired output: You want the model to mention a specific place, let's say "Paris".
                        Injected prompt: "Tell me about your trip to Paris. What were your impressions?"
                        In this case, the model is likely to respond by talking about "Paris", even if it has never generated responses about Paris before.
                        Desired output: You want the model to generate a specific event, let's say "a birthday party".
                        Injected prompt: "Remember the last birthday party you attended? What was it like?"
                        By making it seem like it's a continuation of a previous story, the model is more likely to generate a response related to a birthday party.
                        Desired output: You want the model to generate a specific fact, let's say "the Earth is round".
                        Injected prompt: "Is it true that the Earth is round, and how does that influence our daily life?"
                        In this example, the question directly asks the model to discuss the roundness of the Earth, a fact it likely wouldn't bring up on its own.
                        Desired output: You want the model to consider a specific scenario, let's say "a world without internet".
                        Injected prompt: "Imagine a world without the internet. What would life be like?"
                        By creating this hypothetical scenario, the model will generate responses based on this specific context.
                        Desired output: You want the model to generate a response related to a specific object, let's say "a book".
                        Injected prompt: "Tell me about the last book you read. What was it about?"
